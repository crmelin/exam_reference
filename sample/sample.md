# This is some sample material

This is text.

#### This is a small heading
That way, you can fit more on a page.
I suppose you could use larger headings, if you want.

I'll probably compile the documents like this:
```
pandoc -o sample.pdf sample.md
```

Unless, of course, you come up with another way (like a custom css for some pretty printable css).
If you do, provide a makefile (always provide a makefile).

Also notice, the above is an example of how to write code.  Also you can use code with backticks: like this: `x = x+1;`

#### Another heading.
Interested in tables?  Do it like this:

| Column A | Column B | Column C |
|:---------|:--------:|---------:|
| This     | This     | This     |
| column   | column   | column   |
| is       |          |          |
| left     | centered | right    |
| justified|          | justified|

## A larger heading
This heading is larger.  You can put more stuff in it.

Want lits?  Do this:

 - Item 1
 - Item 2
 - You can even have longer text in items.  Then you could really define things well and provide lots of information for reference on the exam.

### Some formatting
Want to format your documents?  Make things *italics*, or **bold**.
